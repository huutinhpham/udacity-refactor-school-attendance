Udacity-Attendance-App-Refactor
===============================

## Description

In this project I took Udacity's legacy code for an attendance application and refactored it with *MVC* in mind. HTML, and javaScript files were refactored. To see the difference simply compare the legacy-\* files against the refactored-\* ones.

All functionalities and styles were kept as they were, the only difference is the code inside the app. To test functionalities simply open the HTML files using a desired browser.

## Languages

* **javaScript**
* **HTML**

## Tools

* **jQuery**
* **MVC**

## Credits

Legacy codes were prodived by Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree.

Refactored codes were written by me.
